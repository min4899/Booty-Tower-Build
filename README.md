# Booty-Tower-Build
This repository stores build versions that others can try out.

How to play:

The player's goal is to climb as high as possible in a tower filled with treasure.

The player is constantly jumping even without player input.

Player can be moved left by touching the left half of the screen and to the right by touching the right half of the screen.

The faster the player is moving horizontally, the higher the jump momentum.

The player can also maintain horizontally momentum by bouncing off the walls.

The tower has trap platforms that can trigger different types of traps if the player steps on them.
